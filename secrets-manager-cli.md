<!-- File guidance:
This template is for creating command-line interface (CLI) reference that's generated by the OpenAPI SDKGen project. This template includes only the front matter for your CLI reference. You'll paste the command information that's generated from the CLI after this front matter content.
 
Name your file `offering-cli-name.md`, for example, `container-registry-cli.md` is the file name of the Container Registry CLI reference topic. Delete content examples that you are not using for your offering and these comments before pushing to production. -->

<!-- Title guidance:
In the title, list the name of your CLI, such as "Container Registry CLI (ibmcloud cr): https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli
Also provide an appropriate ID above that aligns with your offering name, for example: #container-registry-cli. *All* IDs must be unique across *all* CLI references. -->

# Secrets Manager CLI (ibmcloud sm)
{: #secrets-manager-cli}

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use this cli. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include your offering's CLI name. Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.
Example: -->

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} command-line interface (CLI) provides extra capabilities for service offerings. You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI to manage V2 service brokers and templates.

<!-- Prerequisites: REQUIRED
This section tells users what's required to install and use the CLI commands. If your plug-in requires detailed or lengthy configuration steps, link out to a separate task topic. -->

<!-- Change the ID below to match your CLI. -->
## Prerequisites
{: #secrets-manager-cli-prereq}

* Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
* Install the Secrets Manager CLI by running the following command:

   ```sh
   ibmcloud plugin install secrets-manager
   ```
   {: pre}
   <!-- Replace the <cli-plugin> above with the name of your CLI plug-in. Run 'ibmcloud plugin repo-plugins' to find the name.-->

<!-- Optionally include any other post-installation configuration that might be required for your service. -->

    You're notified on the command line when updates to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up to date so that you can use the latest commands. You can view the current version of all installed plug-ins by running `ibmcloud plugin list`.
    {: tip}

<!-- Other Prerequisites/Authorization/Environment: OPTIONAL
List any other prerequisites/authorization/environments that are required to use the CLI commands. Or give a brief introduction to the prerequisites/authorization/environments that the CLI commands might use. Use H3 headings (###) as needed to organize your content.
Example:

    {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI requires Java&trade 1.8.0. You can download the CLI from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} to use on your local system as a complement to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
